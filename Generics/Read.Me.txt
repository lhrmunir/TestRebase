Please see attached images (img_step_1.png, and img_step_2.png).
/*
    The < E > is called a formal type parameter.
    It is not the return type of the method.
    It basically says that the method can accept as parameters arrays of different types (E[] inputArray).
*/

 public static <E> void printArray( E[] inputArray ) {
     // Display array elements
     for ( E element : inputArray ){
        System.out.printf( "%s ", element );
     }
     System.out.println();
   }

/*
    It's not the type of the returned object.
    It indicates that E, in the method signature, is a generic type and not a concrete type.
    Without it, the compiler would look for a class named E for the argument of the method.
