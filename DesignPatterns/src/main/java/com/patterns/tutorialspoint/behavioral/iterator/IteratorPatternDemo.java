/*
Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation.

Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

Implementation
We're going to create a Iterator interface which narrates navigation method and a Container interface which retruns the iterator . Concrete classes implementing the Container interface will be responsible to implement Iterator interface and use it

IteratorPatternDemo, our demo class will use NamesRepository, a concrete class implementation to print a Names stored as a collection in NamesRepository.



Step 3
        Use the NameRepository to get iterator and print names.
*/
public class IteratorPatternDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NameRepository namesRepository = new NameRepository();

        for(Iterator iter = namesRepository.getIterator(); iter.hasNext();){
            String name = (String)iter.next();
            System.out.println("Name : " + name);
        }
    }
}
