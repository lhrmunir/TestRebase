Is Comparator a function interface, but it has two abstract methods?

Answer
Yes, Comparator is a functional interface. The equals is an abstract method overriding one of the public methods of java.lang.Object, this doesnâ€™t count as an abstract method.


boolean equals(Object obj);
The Comparator only has one abstract method int compare(T o1, T o2), and it meet the definition of functional interface.
